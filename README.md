BACKEND:

This project was designed to run on a MySQL database. To run it without trouble, I recommend to run with MySQL too.
1. Run `npm i` command || `yarn`
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. Run `npm typeorm migration:run` command || `yarn typeorm migration:run`
4. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` || `yarn start` or `yarn dev:server` to compile the project and run on `hhtp://localhost:3333`
